👋 Hi, I’m @gr3yj0rd1
👀 I’m passionate about software engineering, cybersecurity, and crafting elegant, scalable solutions.
🌱 Right now, I’m diving into OdinProject to sharpen my skills in full-stack development, mastering languages like C, C#, and JavaScript along the way.
💞️ I’m excited to collaborate on open-source projects, coding challenges, or anything that pushes the boundaries of software development.
😄 Pronouns: He/Him
⚡ Fun fact: I got a job by simply saying to HR: Hire me.
